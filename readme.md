#Chapter 24 Project

Test **MyArrayList**

Design and write a complete test program to test if the **MyArrayList** class in listing 24.3 meets
all requirements:
* create a list
* add to a list
* ensure capacity
* clear a list
* check if a list contains an element
* check a list index
* get the index of an element
* get the last index of an element
* remove an element
* set the value of an element
* toString representation of the list
* trim the list size to the current array
* implements an iterator for the list

You will need to implement the methods to be able to test them. Some of the implementations are part of the book's even solutions to 24.2.

##Tasks
Submit the test program you created using git.
